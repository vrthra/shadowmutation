# Shadow Mutations

Run `make` to run the full evaluation. The command `make test`, runs the tests.
While, `make <subject>` runs the evaluation for a subjects file matching `examples/<subject>.py`.

Adding a new subject, is done by adding a file matching the above path.
As this is a prototype, the subjects will have to be quite limited.

If there is a error like: 
"Unknown file: {file_name}, add it to the top of shadow.py"
If the file should be ignored or counted towards the tool files, add it to the respective list.
